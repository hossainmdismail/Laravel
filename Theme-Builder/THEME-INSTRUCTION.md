### Explanation of Files and Folders

1. **`assets/`**:  
   - This folder contains the theme's assets, including CSS, JavaScript, and image files.
   - The contents of this folder will be copied into the `public` folder for the theme to work properly.
   
2. **`demo/`**:
   - Contains files that provide a live preview of the theme.
   - The main file here is `index.blade.php`, which should render the theme's layout without any internal errors, allowing users to view a preview of the theme in action.

3. **`<theme-folder-name>.json`**:
   - This file stores metadata related to the theme, including:
     - Theme name
     - Description
     - Author information
     - Version number
     - Required dependencies
   - Ensure the filename matches the theme folder name, e.g., `synex-theme.json` for the `synex-theme` folder.

4. **`<theme-folder-name>.png`**:
   - This is the thumbnail image representing the theme. It will be displayed as a preview in the theme selection or installation screen.
   - The filename must match the theme folder name, e.g., `synex-theme.png` for the `synex-theme` folder.

### Required Files

To ensure the theme functions correctly and can be previewed live, each theme must include:
- A **thumbnail image** for the preview (PNG format).
- A **JSON file** for theme information (metadata).
- An **assets folder** with all the required files that will be moved into the public folder.
- A **demo folder** with a functional `index.blade.php` for live theme previews.

### Example of Theme JSON Structure

Below is an example structure for the theme's `.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "Synex Theme",
  "description": "A modern and clean theme for websites.",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "bootstrap": "^5.0.0",
    "jquery": "^3.6.0"
  }
}
